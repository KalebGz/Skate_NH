        <p class="title" id="ramp_title">The Ramp</p>
        <p class="col" id="ramp_text">
          The ramp is a smooth and long incline in front of Hendrie Hall with a
          wide curb at the end. Ollying over the curve is great way to learn to
          clear ground obstacles because the ramp allows you to build up enough
          speed. My only caution is that there is a wooden fence next to it so
          be wary of your arms when clearing the curb. Outside of working on
          balance without pushing off, you can also practice your tic tacs and
          carving by trying to turn into the hendrie curb or riding off the
          bottom of the ramp.

        <p class="col" id="four_stair_text">
          I would only recommend trying the 4 stair if you have a couple of
          months of practice and are really comfortable with your Ollies. The
          stairs are long and there is decently tall which also makes them
          perfect for firecrackering down them. The stairs also have rails for
          those that really want to tempt fate.
