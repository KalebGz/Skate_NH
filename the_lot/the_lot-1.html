            The lot holds a very special place in my heart because it is the
            place I consider to have first became comfortable riding a
            skateboard. Lot 51, as known to Yale administration and security,
            takes up almost the entirety of the space between Temple and college
            street. This massive amount of space combined with its incredibly
            convenient proximity to central campus(right across from
            cross-campus) makes it the perfect spot for the novice skater to get
            comfortable on the board while also allowing the more experienced
            skater to work on their fundamentals and still have little fun. Here
            are some of my favorite features of the lot and included with it are
            suggestions for what tricks and skills I think go well with them.

            Don’t be too loud if you’re skating outside of the recommended times
            because one of the buildings surrounding the lot is part of the
            school of music and they’re not too fond of skaters

          <li id="tip-2">
            There is no grocery store in close proximity so make sure to pack
            some water and/or snacks before a long sesh

          <p class="title">The Crack</p>
          <p>
            The crack’s purpose is just in its name. It is a small crack that
            runs along the center of the lot in between two parking spots. The
            crack is perfect for working on any trick that doesn’t require
            movement. Anything from Ollies to practicing stationary manual are
            perfect on the crack because it braces your back wheels just enough
            that the board doesn’t move without keeping too strong of a grip on
            it.

          <p class="title">Cones and Boards</p>
          <p>
            The spaciousness of the lot also allows for the ability to create
            your own obstacles and structures. You can find long wooden boards
            close to the lot thanks to the construction going on behind slifka.
            You can use this to practice your Ollies and also rolling off curbs.
            Just make sure to put it back! You will also find random cones
            scattered around the lot to create structures of whatever height to
            practice your Ollies and hippy jumps.

        <!-- Hendrie -->
        <div id="feature-3" class="col">
          <p class="title">Hendrie Curb</p>
          <p>
            The hendrie curb serves a similar purpose to the slick curb, but it
            is slightly smaller and has a much shorter run up. Although the
            shortness of the platforms length makes building up speed difficult,
            there is a ramp connected to it that allows you to build up speed
            for any trick off the curb. The height of the curbs also unlocks the
            ability to start working on balance and grinding by working on
            sloppy grinds and similar tricks.
          </p>

        <!-- Slifka -->
        <div id="feature-4" class="col">
          <p class="title">Slifka Curb</p>
          <p>
            The slifka curb is your typical sidewalk curve which is what makes
            it so perfect. It is the the most practical portion of the park
            because you can learn to get comfortable with getting over curb
            warning pavers, skating off curbs and also ollying onto curbs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <img
          class="col"
          id="feature-4_image"
          src="../media/lot_photos/slifka.jpg"
          alt="Picture of Slifka"
        />

        <!-- Ramp -->
        <div id="feature-5" class="col">
          <p class="title">The Ramp</p>
          <p>
            The ramp is a smooth and long incline in front of Hendrie Hall with
            a wide curb at the end. Ollying over the curve is great way to learn
            to clear ground obstacles because the ramp allows you to build up
            enough speed. My only caution is that there is a wooden fence next
            to it so be wary of your arms when clearing the curb. Outside of
            working on balance without pushing off, you can also practice your
            tic tacs and carving by trying to turn into the hendrie curb or
            riding off the bottom of the ramp.

        <!-- four_stair -->
        <div id="feature-6" class="col">
          <p class="title">The Ramp</p>
          <p>
            I would only recommend trying the 4 stair if you have a couple of
            months of practice and are really comfortable with your Ollies. The
            stairs are long and there is decently tall which also makes them
            perfect for firecrackering down them. The stairs also have rails for
            those that really want to tempt fate.
