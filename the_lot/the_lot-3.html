        <p class="col" id="slifka_text">
          The slifka curb is your typical sidewalk curve which is what makes it
          so perfect. It is the the most practical portion of the park because
          you can learn to get comfortable with getting over curb warning
          pavers, skating off curbs and also ollying onto curbs.

        <p class="col" id="hendrie_text">
          The hendrie curb serves a similar purpose to the slick curb, but it is
          slightly smaller and has a much shorter run up. Although the shortness
          of the platforms length makes building up speed difficult, there is a
          ramp connected to it that allows you to build up speed for any trick
          off the curb. The height of the curbs also unlocks the ability to
          start working on balance and grinding by working on sloppy grinds and
          similar tricks.
