        <p class="title" id="crack_title">The Crack</p>
        <p class="col" id="crack_text">
          The crack’s purpose is just in its name. It is a small crack that runs
          along the center of the lot in between two parking spots. The crack is
          perfect for working on any trick that doesn’t require movement.
          Anything from Ollies to practicing stationary manual are perfect on
          the crack because it braces your back wheels just enough that the
          board doesn’t move without keeping too strong of a grip on it.
        </p>

        <p class="col" id="conesB_text">
          The spaciousness of the lot also allows for the ability to create your
          own obstacles and structures. You can find long wooden boards close to
          the lot thanks to the construction going on behind slifka. You can use
          this to practice your Ollies and also rolling off curbs. Just make
          sure to put it back! You will also find random cones scattered around
          the lot to create structures of whatever height to practice your
          Ollies and hippy jumps.
