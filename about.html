          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Kaleb Gezahegn, and I'm a rising Junior at Yale
            University! The rigor of school and academic activities takes up a
            majority of my time here, and I found it very difficult to make good
            use of the little free time I had over my first few semesters. It
            was only about three months ago that I was reintroduced to the world
            of skateboarding after having been away from it for years. After
            taking a while to find some spots on campus that Yale's security
            tolerated and making a couple of friends skating, I was back to
            skating everywhere and invested in the local skate scene.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Follow me as I take you through the journey I took to rediscover
            this passion and around different skate spots around Yaleâ€™s campus
            and New Haven. Grab your helmet, shin-pads, best friend, lucky
            rabbit's foot? and whatever you think will make you more comfortable
            as you explore a new hobby and learn about the new haven skate
            scene.
          </p>
