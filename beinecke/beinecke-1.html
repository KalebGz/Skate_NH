            The Beienecke plaza always has a spot on the checklist for anyone
            touring Yale because is beautiful. It also is next to a library that
            has some rare books or whatever. Most of the plaza was not
            accessible because of the construction going on at commons, but the
            wait has left us with better lightning that makes this one of the
            few skate spots available at night. You will occasionally bump into
            tourists but you will also probably find yourself other college
            students also trying to learn how to skate just as frequently. There
            will also be the occasional sponsored skaters doing crazy things
            that you just stand and admire.

            Skate as far away from Alexander walk(the path in front of beinecke)

            Beinecke library houses some of the rarest books in the world which
            made climate control a necessity when designing the library and
            plaza. Part of this design was to build the plaza with panels
            arranged in a grid with rubber linings separating them. These rubber
            linings are just deep enough between the panels that they catch your
            wheels if you place your board over them while still allowing for a
            smooth ride if you’ve got a little bit of speed. These make them
            functionally very similar to the crack from the lot where you can
            practice many stationary tricks. These are also great for learning
            or improving your Ollies.

            The plaza in itself is a great resource to use whenever in the area.
            I sometimes find myself stopping doing a lap over the plaza whenever
            I pass by it just because of how smooth the ride is. The layout of
            the plaza is great for building up leg strength by doing laps around
            the library and the sunken courtyard in front of the library. The
            chairs, tables, columns, and other maneuverable obstacles also make
            this spot great for playing skate tag which is just tag but on
            boards.

            The commons steps is a 3 stair with really wide and long steps that
            serve as a great way to start getting comfortable with clearing
            stairs. The wide design of these steps makes them great for fire
            cracking, ollying, or simply slowly riding off.

          <p class="title">The Benches</p>
          <p>
            The plaza has rows of stone benches scattered around its sides. You
            might have already noticed that the outside corners of these are a
            couple of shades darker than the rest of them. This is the product
            of years of experienced skaters waxing the corners and skating them.
            These benches are a good 2.5 feet off the ground though so wait
            until you can constantly Olly up to around that height stationary
            before trying anything with them.

            The 5 stair in front of commons is great for the more seasoned
            skater to practice their skate tricks. The platform above the stairs
            is very short but you can gather a decent amount of speed to clear
            it with a decent throw-in. There are also rails on the side for
            those comfortable with grinds but be careful not to smack your board
            on the pillars next to the rails.
