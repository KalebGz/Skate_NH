            <h2 id=title> Beinecke Plaza</h2>
            <p id="description">
                The Beienecke plaza always has a spot on the checklist for anyone touring Yale because is beautiful. It also is next to a library that has some rare books or whatever. Most of the plaza was not accessible because of the construction going on at commons, but the wait has left us with better lightning that makes this one of the few skate spots available at night. You will occasionally bump into tourists but you will also probably find yourself other college students also trying to learn how to skate just as frequently. There will also be the occasional sponsored skaters doing crazy things that you just stand and admire.
