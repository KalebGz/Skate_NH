          The commons steps is a 3 stair with really wide and long steps that serve as a great way to start getting comfortable with clearing stairs. The wide design of these steps makes them great for fire cracking, ollying, or simply slowly riding off.

        <p class="col" id="hendrie_text">
          The plaza has rows of stone benches scattered around its sides. You might have already noticed that the outside corners of these are a couple of shades darker than the rest of them. This is the product of years of experienced skaters waxing the corners and skating them. These benches are a good 2.5 feet off the ground though so wait until you can constantly Olly up to around that height stationary before trying anything with them.
