            Scantlebury skatepark is located behind Yale health and is the
            closest park to Yale’s campus. The skatepark is part of a larger
            park that also shares it name. Because of the limited funding and
            space in the park, this skate park is quite smaller than most. What
            it lacks in space, it makes up for in quality because it is
            relatively new for a skatepark. It was actually finished about a
            year ago and conceived by a Yale alum J. Joseph and a friend.

        <!-- Wave Ramp -->
        <div id="feature-1" class="col">
          <p class="title">Wave Ramp</p>
          <p>
            The wave ramp is the first thing that you see when you get to the
            skate park. It is a set of 3 smoothened bumps that allow you to
            build up speed and direct you back out through the park entrance.
            You get to it by going up on the second platform on the side
            opposite side of the park and then walking around the edge back
            towards the front. You can also just run up the top ramp. I use this
            ramp mostly for fun, but it is also great for learning how to
            distribute your body weight for increased speed.
          </p>

        <!--Quarter Pipe -->

          <p class="title">Quarter Pipe</p>
          <p>
            There are a bunch of quarter pipes around the park. These ramps are
            great for first learning to drop in because they are just the right
            height on my opinion. They are high enough that you have some time
            to gather your footing before reaching the end of the ramp and they
            are not to tall that you won’t get yourself to commit. I would
            recommend first practicing the motion of dropping in on the angled
            corner in the middle of the skatepark and then trying this once your
            comfortable with slapping down the board.

          <p class="title">Lego Block</p>
          <p>
            The block is a short slab of concrete on the back of the skate park
            with metal plates on the corners. The slab is slightly taller than
            the average curb but it is still great for practicing your Ollies
            once you feel like you’re getting comfortable with getting over
            curbs. You can also learn to be more comfortable on the board by
            going over the half pipe and turning onto the block.

        <!-- The Courts -->
        <div id="feature-4" class="col">
          <p class="title">The Courts</p>
          <p>
            The skate park is also just a part of a larger normal park that has
            two basketball courts and two tennis courts. These open areas are
            great for flat ground tricks and more importantly, for being more
            comfortable on your board. I sometimes do laps around the basketball
            courts as fast as I can which is a great drill for building up a
            good understanding for board foot placement.

        <!-- 5-Stair -->
        <div id="feature-5" class="col">
          <p class="title">The Platform</p>
          <p>
            The platform is where a lot of the traffic of the park is centered
            at. All the half pipes point to this part of the park so you can
            build up speed from the top of tamps and then transition to ollying
            over the ramps, grinding over the corners or maybe even going down
            its own ramp to build up more speed. The platform also has an angled
            metal rail for those that want to get better at grinding rails..
