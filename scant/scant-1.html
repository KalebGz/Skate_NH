            <p id="description">
                Scantlebury skatepark is located behind Yale health and is the closest park to Yaleâ€™s campus. The skatepark is part of a larger park that also shares it name. Because of the limited funding and space in the park, this  skate park is quite smaller than most. What it lacks in space, it makes up for in quality because it is relatively new for a skatepark. It was actually finished about a year ago and conceived by a Yale alum J. Joseph and a friend.
