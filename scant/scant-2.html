        <p class="title" id="crack_title">Wave ramp</p>
        <p class="col" id="crack_text">
          The wave ramp is the first thing that you see when you get to the skate park. It is a set of 3 smoothened bumps that allow you to build up speed and direct you back out through the park entrance. You get to it by going up on the second platform on the side opposite side of the park and then walking around the edge back towards the front. You can also just run up the top ramp. I use this ramp mostly for fun, but it is also great for learning how to distribute your body weight for increased speed.

        <p class="title" id="conesB_title">Quarter pipe        </p>
        <p class="col" id="conesB_text">
          There are a bunch of quarter pipes around the park. These ramps are great for first learning to drop in because they are just the right height on my opinion. They are high enough that you have some time to gather your footing before reaching the end of the ramp and they are not to tall that you wonâ€™t get yourself to commit.  I would recommend first practicing the motion of dropping in on the angled corner in the middle of the skatepark and then trying this once your comfortable with slapping down the board.
