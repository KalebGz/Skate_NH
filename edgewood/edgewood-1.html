            Edgewood skatepark is located in the middle of another park which, like Scantlebury, shares its name and is great for a post or pre-skate stroll. Although This skatepark is completely removed from Yale’s campus, it is only a 20-minute skate away. Its removal from Yale’s campus also means that a majority of the people skating there are new haven locals. The regulars there are usually very friendly, so don’t be too shy to strike up a conversation. Most of them have been around for a while, so they’re quite familiar with the skate scene in New Haven. Make sure to ask them about other skate spots they frequent!

        <div id="feature-1" class="col">
          <p class="title">Small Half-Pipe</p>
          <p>
            The short half-pipe is located in the bottom left corner of the skatepark. To my knowledge, this is probably the best pipe in New Haven for learning how to drop in. The ends of the pipe are about two feet high which gives you just enough space to practice dropping in on the concave portion of the ramp without making it too difficult to commit. There are also usually a good number of people learning how to drop in here, so try to learn from them if you ever feel stuck. Once you feel comfortable dropping in, you can start practicing your front rock to fakie, side axle stalls, crooked stalls, tail stalls, and most other stalls.

        <div id="feature-2" class="col">
          <p class="title">Big Half-Pipe</p>
          <p>
            This half-pipe is significantly larger than the one mentioned before and is located directly behind the shorter one that I just mentioned. You can access it using a built-in ladder on the right portion of the pipe or run up the curved portion of the pipe. I recommend learning how to run up ramps as soon as possible because of their convenience and since not all ramps come with a ladder. I recommend practicing dropping in again on this ramp and then slowly progressing to simple stalls. Since you can build up a lot more speed on this pipe, you can then try out more stalls like sugarcane stalls, front side disaster, and so on.

        <!-- Blocks Rails -->

          <p class="title">Blocks and Rails</p>
          <p>
            There are rails and angled blocks of all sizes scattered throughout the middle of the park. I’m personally not the biggest fan of grinding and don’t work on it much, so I use the blocks and benches to work on my Ollies and other pop tricks. If you are interested in learning how to grind though, there are definitely some beginner-friendly rails.

        <div id="feature-4" class="col">
          <p class="title">Spine with Rail</p>
          <p>
            The spine is one of my favorite ramps at this skatepark. The ramp is not very practical and I’ve mostly seen it used only in the context of people riding over it or stopping at the middle and then rolling off after some standing transition. Until you feel comfortable with getting enough speed to clear the ramp, I recommend rolling up to the middle of the ramp, stalling, and then turning back around. For those that are interested in grinding, there is also a rail attached to the spine that you get to by hitting the spine at an angle.

          <p class="title">The Bowl</p>
          <p>
            The best way I can describe the entire back corner of this skatepark is as a Wide bowl. Although it isn’t fully enclosed, you can treat it as one by riding up the ramp and looping the ramps in the middle. I usually find myself in this section of the park because it is great for improving my weight distribution, but more importantly, I just think it's really fun to skate this!
