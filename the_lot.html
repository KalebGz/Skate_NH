            <h2 id=title> THE LOT</h2>
            <p id="description">
                The lot holds a very special place in my heart because it is the place I consider to have first became comfortable riding a skateboard. Lot 51, as known to Yale administration and security, takes up almost the entirety of the space between Temple and college street. This massive amount of space combined with its incredibly convenient proximity to central campus(right across from cross-campus) makes it the perfect spot for the novice skater to get comfortable on the board while also allowing the more experienced skater to work on their fundamentals and still have little fun. Here are some of my favorite features of the lot and included with it are suggestions for what tricks and skills I think go well with them.

            <ul>
                <li id="tip-1"> Don’t be too loud if you’re skating outside of the recommended times because one of the buildings surrounding the lot is part of the school of music and they’re not too fond of skaters</li>
                <li id="tip-2"> There is no grocery store in close proximity so make sure to pack some water and/or snacks before a long sesh</li>
                <li id="tip-3">  Some people might still call Yale security, but they’re usually very understanding and will only tell you to leave the lot for the day </li>
